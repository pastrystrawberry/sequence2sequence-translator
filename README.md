# sequence2sequence-translator
A Sequence-to-Sequence (Seq2Seq) translator is a neural network model that converts an input sequence into an output sequence, commonly used for language translation. It uses an encoder to process input data and a decoder to generate the output. Attention or Transformer mechanisms enhance accuracy for long or complex sequences.
